# Point Clustering Optimization

## Description

This is a solution - implementation of an algorithm that, taking points in n-dimensional space and maximum number of clusters, 
assigns each point to the appropriate group so that the sum of Euclidean distances between points belonging to the same group is as small as possible. 

This was the solution for a competition.

I eventually took 9th place in the competition.

The solution focused mainly on performance/time efficiency and on giving the best results.
